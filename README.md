This project was an absolute blast. The assignment was to create a landing page based off of an example provided by the The Odin Project. Fonts, font sizes, and weighting were provided for me as well. I decided to create a landing page for a cooking club that I attend once a month.

This assignment taught me so much and also solidified some of my confidence in what I knew (and what I don't know--yet!). I was surprised at how much of the earlier lessons I was able to recall, from creating an HTML boilerplate to changing flex directions. I was surprised at how quickly I caught on to using flexbox and changing the direction of the display to achieve the right outcome. 

I also learned the value of creating different containers for different groups of HTML elements and gained a better understanding of how containers, element classes, and grouping effect the styling process. 

Most of all, I really had fun creating this. The last few days have reiterated to me how passionate I  am about learning web development, and I am so excited to continue through The Odin Project.
